## Pori-Translated
A mod that translates ori and the will of the wisps's text and dialogue into poorly translated versions

**Warning:** some translations might be NSFW

## Instructions:
1. Download **MelonLoader** from https://melonwiki.xyz/#/
2. Open the game first, let it load into the main menu of Ori WOTW
3. Close the game afterwards, the folders created by **MelonLoader** should be generated
4. Move `UniverseLib.IL2CPP.Interop.ML.dll` from the requirements folder into the **UserLibs** folder in your installation
5. Move both `DialogueCore.dll` and `Translations.YAML` into the **Mod** folder
6. Open the game again, everything should be up and running!

## Credits to:

- Shadowofcat and ascdragonite for the mod development  

- Rekku484 for translating all the game's dialogue and text  

- and sinai dev for his universeLib library which the mod uses


Have fun playing!
