a mod that translates ori and the will of the wisps's text and dialogue into poorly translated versions

warning: some translations might be nsfw

## Instructions:
- download melon loader from https://melonwiki.xyz/#/
- open and close the game once to generate the melon loader folders
- move UniverseLib from the requirements folder into the UserLibs folder in your installation
- move both DialogueCore.dll and translations.Yaml into the mod folder
- open the game, everything should be up and running!


## credits to:

- Shadowofcat (me) and dragonite for the mod development  

- rekku for translating all the game's dialogue and text  

- and sinai dev for his universeLib library which the mod uses


 have fun!
